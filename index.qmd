## Clinical background

Solid organ transplantation has transformed survival for patients with end-stage organ disease. For people living with HIV (PLWH), access to transplantation has historically been limited by medical uncertainty, regulatory restrictions, and stigma. Over the past two decades, however, advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) and transplant immunology have substantially changed the clinical landscape.

This project integrates HIV epidemiologic data with SRTR transplant center data to examine geographic access to HIV-experienced transplant programs across the United States.


## Methods

We selected cryptococcus cases based on the following inclusion criteria:

- Age 18 or greater
- Prior kidney transplant
- ICD9 or ICD10 codes for cryptococcus (2 outpatient or 1 inpatient)
- One year of Medicare primary coverage lead-in

Controls were matched 2:1 to cases based on risk-set sampling on the following:

- Time since transplant
- Diabetes
- HIV/AIDS
- Age within 10 years
- Sampling date for control within 3 years of sampling date for case

Institutional claims data were abstracted as well as Physician/Supplier line-item data.

### Reproducibility

All analyses presented on this website are fully reproducible.  

The complete source code used to perform the full analysis and generate the tables and figures is publicly available at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/VagishHemmige/HOPE-CDC-analysis-2026).  The R script `R/main.R` will run the R subscripts needed for this analysis in the order they are to be run.  Model assumptions, parameter values, and analytic workflows are documented in the repository to facilitate transparency and reuse.


## Abstracts/manuscripts

This analysis has yet to be published to date.
