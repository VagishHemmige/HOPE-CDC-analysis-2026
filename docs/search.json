County-level HIV prevalence data from the CDC NCHHSTP AtlasPlus system were integrated with national transplant center location data. Transplant centers were classified by activity status and HIV program participation (including HOPE Act programs).\nGeographic accessibility was estimated using drive-time isochrones generated at standardized morning departure times. Isochrones were unioned across centers and spatially joined to county and tract-level population data to estimate the number and proportion of people living with HIV within defined travel-time thresholds.\nAll data processing and spatial analyses were conducted in R using reproducible workflows built on sf, tigris, and custom functions documented throughout this site. No spatial smoothing or statistical modeling was applied unless explicitly stated.",

Diagnosis code lists defined in R/setup.R are applied uniformly across claims files to establish the presence and timing of comorbid conditions.\nThis portion makes use of the get_IN_ICD() and get_PS_ICD() functions from the usRds package to obtain dates that specific ICD codes are used for patients with a history of at least one kidney transplant in the study period.\nThe establish_dx_date() function from the usRds package uses the results of this analysis to ascertain the date when comorbidities meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis:\n\nTwo outpatient encounters or\nOne inpatient encounter\n\nIn parallel, Medicare coverage history is retrieved for all transplant recipients from the payhist file, which is part of the Core dataest. These data will be used to confirm continuous enrollment during the analytic period. We verify the absence of gaps indicating missing data, noting that every subsequent period in the dataset for a patient starts the day after the previous period ends and thereby supporting valid longitudinal assessment of diagnoses and downstream cost analyses.\nFinally, we separate cryptococcus diagnosis dates from other comorbidities for a separate list, given the key nature of the date of cryptococcus diagnosis for subsequent analyses.\n\n\nCode\n#Create list of USRDS ids for patients who have undergone transplant\ntransplant_id_list&lt;-patients_clean$data%&gt;%\n  pull(USRDS_ID)\n\n# We now seek to determine comorbidities by using diagnosis codes from the setup.R file\n\ncomorbidity_diagnosis_date&lt;-list()\n\n# Combine all ICD codes from all comorbidities into one list \ncomorbidity_ICD_combined_list&lt;-unlist(comorbidity_ICD_list, use.names=FALSE)\n\n#Scrape files for any comorbidity claim\ncomorbidity_claims_df&lt;-bind_rows(get_IN_ICD(icd_codes = comorbidity_ICD_combined_list, \n                                            years = 2006:2021, \n                                            usrds_ids = transplant_id_list ),\n                                 get_PS_ICD(icd_codes = comorbidity_ICD_combined_list, \n                                            years = 2006:2021, \n                                            usrds_ids = transplant_id_list )%&gt;%rename(CODE=DIAG))%&gt;%\n  arrange(USRDS_ID, CLM_FROM)\n\n#Create comorbidity_diagnosis_date data frame\nfor (comorbidity in names(comorbidity_ICD_list)){\n  \n  comorbidity_diagnosis_date[[comorbidity]]&lt;-comorbidity_claims_df%&gt;%\n    filter(CODE %in% comorbidity_ICD_list[[comorbidity]])%&gt;%\n    establish_dx_date(diagnosis_established = comorbidity)\n}\n\n#Load Medicare coverage history for all patients with transplant\nmedicare_history&lt;-load_usrds_file(\"payhist\",\n                                  usrds_ids = transplant_id_list)%&gt;%\n  arrange(USRDS_ID, BEGDATE)%&gt;%\n  group_by(USRDS_ID)%&gt;%\n  mutate(lag_ENDDATE=lag(ENDDATE))%&gt;%\n  mutate(gap=as.numeric(BEGDATE-lag_ENDDATE))%&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(gap))\n\n#Confirm no gaps (gap should always be 1 or missing)\nif (any(!is.na(medicare_history$gap) & medicare_history$gap != 1)) {\n  stop(\"Gap assumption violated: `gap` contains values other than 1 or NA.\")\n}\n\n\n#Format a df with the cryptococcus dx\ncryptococcus_df&lt;-comorbidity_diagnosis_date$cryptococcus%&gt;%\n  select(-diagnosis)%&gt;%\n  rename(cryptococcus_dx_date=date_established)",
